Solana Web3 Journal 📝
A minimalist decentralized application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete personal journal entries directly on the Solana blockchain.

📖 Overview
This project serves as an introductory CRUD application built with the Anchor framework. It demonstrates the fundamental mechanics of allocating space on-chain and securely associating data with a user's wallet without the overhead of complex tokenomics.

Core Features
Write: Users can publish a new journal entry with a title and a message.

Read: Users can fetch and display all their on-chain entries.

Edit: Users can modify the text of an existing entry.

Delete: Users can close the account to delete the entry and reclaim their storage rent.
